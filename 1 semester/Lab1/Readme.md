Variant 7(Graphs)(List 1), Variant 2(Circles and lines)(List 2)
Required tasks:

****graph implementation based on adjacency matrix and list
Operations: add, delete vertex or edge;
            checking for connectivity; 
            finding lowest cost path between 2 vertices

***Circle and line implementation in 2-dimensional subspace
Operations: find the set of intersection points between two figures;
            reflect any object symmetrically to particular line;
            reflect any object inversionally to particular circle;

Additional tasks, which was realized:

* additional algorithms for graphs(bfs, finding amount of cycles in graph)

* unit tests( will be provided in nearest future)

* templated data structures, overloaded operators
