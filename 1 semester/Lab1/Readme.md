Variant 7(Graphs)(List 1), Variant 2(Circles and lines)(List 2)
Required tasks:

****graph implementation based on adjacency matrix and list
Operations: add, delete vertex or edge;
            checking for connectivity; 
            finding lowest cost path between 2 vertices

***Circle and line implementation in 2-dimensional subspace
Operations: find the set of intersection points between two figures;
            reflect any object symmetrically to particular line;
            reflect any object inversionally to particular circle;

Additional tasks, which was realized:

* additional algorithms for graphs(bfs, finding amount of cycles in graph)

* unit tests

* templated data structures, overloaded operators

Version 2.0(Refactored as 2 semester Lab1)

* Refactoring is based on UML diagrams which can be found here: https://github.com/Nalexx6/OOP/tree/master/2%20semester/Lab1UML

* Figures folder is now independent library. Source code of it: https://github.com/Nalexx6/Figures

* Doxygen documentation provided: https://nalexx6.github.io/OOP/1%20semester/Lab1/doc/html/index.html
